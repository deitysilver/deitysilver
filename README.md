## Bio

Welcome to my github profile, feel free to check out my projects ;)

#### About me

My name is \[redacted], I'm just a guy who like computers and chilling, who is also into really niche things \(my pinterest profile is proof of that). I'm live in \[redacted] for the last half decade but was born and raised in \[redacted], I go to \[redacted], and am \[redacted] years old.

Want to work together or just want to chill? Contact me on discord if you want to discuss anything at `deitysilver`. I'm into the sci-fi, horror and fantasy genres in books, movies, series, or anime, so if you have suggestions, feel free to drop some of your favorites. But I'm a windows user, so I hope that isn't a deal breaker for you :D
