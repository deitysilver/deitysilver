## Bio

Welcome to my github profile, feel free to check out my projects ;)

#### About me :-

My name is \[redacted], I'm just a guy who like computers and chilling, and I'm also into really niche things \(my pinterest profile is proof of that). I've been living in \[redacted] for the last half a decade but I was born and raised in \[redacted], I go to \[redacted], and am \[redacted] years old.

Want to work together or just want to chill? Contact me on discord if you want to discuss anything at `deitysilver`. I'm a massive DC and Star Wars fan and I love reading, I prefer reading the sci-fi, horror and fantasy genres, so if you have recommendations, feel free to drop some of your favorites. I'm alsoo a windows user, hope that isn't a deal breaker for you :D
